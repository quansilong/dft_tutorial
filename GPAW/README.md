*Answers to tutorial attendee questions:*

**Does GPAW support GPU?**

Yes, https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/platforms/Bull/curie_gpu.html

**What is the default XC in a GPAW DFT calculation?**

It is LDA, as I said in the tutorial.

*Correction:*

I mentioned that GPAW supports MD - sorry I meant ASE supports MD.
